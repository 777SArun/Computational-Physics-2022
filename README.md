*Description* : Through this project we aim to give basic understanding of various computational methods in physics. Computational physics deals with modelling and simulating various physics problems for which we have a theoretical foundation. The project will introduce various computational techniques and required libraries and conclude with solving computational physics problem(s).

*Mentors* : Shivang Pandey, Divyam Jain
